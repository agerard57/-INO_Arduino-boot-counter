## Detailled description

I started working on this since I wanted to use the I2C method for displaying something on the 7-segment display.
I also wanted to test how to store data into the arduino nano (using EÂ²PROM), even after it has been turned off.

When powered on, the arduino gets from memory the number of times the system has turned on, then displays it and rewrites the old value with the new incremented value. Then, it plays a neat sound ;)

If you want to start from 0, simply press the "reset button" added into the circuit: that will set the number to default.
